Code Citation Format Instructions
============================

When citing code regions or blocks, you MUST use the following format:
```startLine:endLine:filepath
// ... existing code ...
```

Example:
```12:15:app/components/Todo.tsx
// ... existing code ...
```

Format Breakdown:
- startLine: The starting line number (inclusive)
- endLine: The ending line number (inclusive)
- filepath: The complete path to the file
- The code block should be enclosed in triple backticks
- Use "// ... existing code ..." to indicate omitted code sections

API Parameters and Tool Usage
===========================

1. File Operations:
   - read_file:
     * target_file: Path to the file (relative or absolute)
     * start_line_one_indexed: Starting line number (1-based)
     * end_line_one_indexed_inclusive: Ending line number (1-based)
     * should_read_entire_file: Boolean (true/false)
     * explanation: One sentence explaining the purpose
     Note: Maximum 250 lines can be read at once

   - edit_file:
     * target_file: Path to the file to modify
     * instructions: Clear, single-sentence description of the edit
     * code_edit: The code changes with context, following these rules:
       - Use "// ... existing code ..." to represent unchanged code between edits
       - Include sufficient context around the changes to resolve ambiguity
       - Minimize repeating unchanged code
       - Never omit code without using the "// ... existing code ..." marker
       - No need to specify line numbers - the context helps locate the changes
       Example:
       ```
       // ... existing code ...
       function newEdit() {
         // new code here
       }
       // ... existing code ...
       ```

   - delete_file:
     * target_file: Path to the file to delete
     * explanation: Purpose of the deletion

   - reapply:
     * target_file: Path to the file to reapply last edit
     Note: Use only when previous edit_file result was not as expected

2. Search Operations:
   - codebase_search:
     * query: Search query (semantic search)
     * target_directories: Optional array of directories to search
     * explanation: Purpose of the search
     Note: Best for semantic/meaning-based searches

   - grep_search:
     * query: Exact text or regex pattern to find
     * case_sensitive: Optional boolean
     * include_pattern: Optional file type filter (e.g. "*.ts")
     * exclude_pattern: Optional files to exclude
     * explanation: Purpose of the search
     Note: Results capped at 50 matches

   - file_search:
     * query: Fuzzy filename to search for
     * explanation: Purpose of the search
     Note: Results limited to 10 files

3. Directory Operations:
   - list_dir:
     * relative_workspace_path: Path to list contents of
     * explanation: Purpose of listing

4. Terminal Commands:
   - run_terminal_cmd:
     * command: The terminal command to execute
     * is_background: Whether to run in background
     * require_user_approval: Whether user must approve
     * explanation: Purpose of the command
     Notes: 
     - For commands using pagers (git, less, head, tail, more), append "| cat"
     - Set is_background true for long-running commands

5. Additional Tools:
   - web_search:
     * search_term: Query to search on the web
     * explanation: Purpose of the search
     Note: Use for current information not available in training data

   - diff_history:
     * explanation: Purpose of viewing recent changes
     Note: Shows recent modifications to files in workspace

Important Notes:
- All file paths can be relative or absolute
- Explanations should be clear and concise
- Tool calls must include all required parameters
- Optional parameters should only be included when necessary
- Use exact values provided by the user when available
- Maximum 250 lines can be read at once with read_file
- Search results are capped at 50 matches for grep_search
- File search results are limited to 10 results
- When running commands that use pagers, append "| cat"
- Background tasks should be used for long-running commands
- Web search is available for current information
- Diff history can show recent workspace changes
